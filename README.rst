imagelib
========

The tube42 imagelib is a minimal image manipulation library for J2ME phones. 
It was initially published on my blog in a series of articles about lightweight image processing:

* Part 1: `Basic RGB image manipulation <http://blog.tube42.se/?p=688>`_
* Part 2: `Image resizing <http://blog.tube42.se/?p=717>`_
* Part 3: `Performance enhancement and Blackberry code <http://blog.tube42.se/?p=901>`_
* Part 4: `Image effects <http://blog.tube42.se/?p=902>`_
* Part 5: `Performance of transparent vs. opaque blit <http://blog.tube42.se/?p=1076>`_
* Part 6: `Updates to the filter and pixel modifiers + 2D filtering support <http://blog.tube42.se/?p=1159>`_

Currently, the library contains functions for color operations including interpolation, blending and RGB/YCbCr conversion, image operations including resizing, blending, filtering and pixel modifiers and some simple image analysis functions.

Great, but what is it for?
--------------------------
You can for example use the imagelib to

* dynamically resize your graphics, depending on the detected screen size
* create a "retro effect" application

What is it NOT good for?
------------------------

* J2ME is slow and so are most J2ME phones. Given that image processing is very CPU intensive, this library is NOT suitable for real-time effects and such.

Examples
--------
The source code contains a MIDlet sample project that demonstrates many aspects of the library. 
The following images were generated by the sample project running on a phone:
